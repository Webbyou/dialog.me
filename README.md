# dialog_me

A cognitive conversation mobile application developed with Flutter and Google Dialogflow.
The application uses the BLoC pattern to manage the app's state and render the bot's response to the app.

## Getting Started
Create a Google Dialogflow agent and download the service account credentials of the project in your google account console.
Add the downloaded json file to the assets folder and rename it as *bot_auth.json*.

Run the app and keep chatting with your bot.

P.S. WIP: The app captures only TEXT messages.
